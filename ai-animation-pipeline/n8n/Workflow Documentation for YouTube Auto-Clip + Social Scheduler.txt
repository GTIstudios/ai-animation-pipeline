### `youtube_viral_clip_scheduler.json`

This workflow analyzes a long-form YouTube video, automatically identifies high-value segments, clips the video into 3–6 short viral-ready pieces, adds captions, exports the clips, and schedules them for automated posting across social platforms.

This workflow represents a full AI-assisted media distribution engine designed to maximize reach without manual editing.

   - Converts to vertical/portrait format if needed  
   - Adds subtitles/captions  
   - Normalizes audio  
   - Exports clips into a ready-to-publish folder
